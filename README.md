# Potholes Detection: An AIoT application to facilitate city micro-mobility


> Personal project for CASA0018 Deep Learning for Sensor Network



## Why Detecting Potholes?
With the increased importance people place on their health, real-time air quality reports have become even more important in the present day. The OpenWeatherMap API is used as the data source and the air quality data is visualised by using a 3D printed device and an AR app that shows the digital twin of that device. The air quality parameters are displayed by the dials on the device. The pointers of the dials on both digital and virtual devices can be changed in real-time depending on the API.
